            RCB vs GT Highlights, IPL 2023: Shubman Gill's unbeaten century powered Gujarat Titans to six-wicket win 
            over Royal Challengers Bangalore at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Sunday. The win eliminated 
            RCB from playoffs, while Mumbai Indians advanced. They joined GT, Chennai Super Kings and 
            Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2023 playoffs. Talking about the game, Virat Kohli scored unbeaten 
            101 off 61 balls as RCB posted 197 for 5 in 20 overs after GT skipper Hardik Pandya won the toss and 
            opted to bowl. In reply, Gill's unbeaten century took GT home with 5 balls to spare.

        The pressure created by Harshal Patel's 6-run over has been wasted as Himanshu Sharma has bowled a 12-run over. 
        Gujarat Titans need 96 runs in 54 balls. The asking rate is still below 11 and with the likes of Tewatia, Miller, 
        Hardik and Rashid to come, 
        they will back themselves to chase it down from here. 
        A no-ball followed by a wide ball and then a six by Shubman Gill to finish the game for Gujarat Titans. GT win 
        the game by 6 wickets and that means RCB are out of IPL 2023 and Mumbai Indians advance.
